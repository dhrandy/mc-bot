# mc-bot

**EXPERIMENTAL BETA** - a small Minecraft Java bot controlled through an HTTP JSON API. It has not yet been verified against a live server. Expect rough edges; do not give it valuable inventory or unrestricted access to a production world.

The bot signs into an **online-mode** server using a Microsoft account that owns Minecraft Java Edition. It can report position/status, read recent chat, send chat, follow a visible player, walk near coordinates, look at coordinates, and stop moving. There is no autonomous AI model in the container: any authorized client can call the API.

## Start with Docker Compose

Use Node 22+ and Docker Compose. Clone this repo, then create `.env` next to `compose.yaml`:

```dotenv
MC_HOST=minecraft.example.net
MC_PORT=25565
MC_VERSION=
MC_ACCOUNT_ID=bot-account-alias
API_PORT=42883
API_TOKEN=replace-with-a-random-secret-at-least-32-characters
```

`MC_ACCOUNT_ID` is a stable cache identifier for the account, not its password or in-game name. Use the same identifier after restart so the cached login is reused. `MC_VERSION` may be blank to auto-detect. Generate a fresh, long random API token, for example `openssl rand -hex 32`; never commit the real `.env`. The `bot-auth` volume contains Microsoft authentication tokens; keep it private and back it up or sign in again if it is lost.

Copy-paste Compose block (`compose.yaml` in this repo):

```yaml
services:
  mc-bot:
    build: .
    container_name: mc-bot
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MC_HOST: ${MC_HOST}
      MC_PORT: ${MC_PORT}
      MC_VERSION: ${MC_VERSION}
      MC_ACCOUNT_ID: ${MC_ACCOUNT_ID}
      API_TOKEN: ${API_TOKEN}
      API_PORT: "42883"
      AUTH_CACHE_DIR: /data/auth
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:${API_PORT}:42883"
    volumes:
      - bot-auth:/data/auth
volumes:
  bot-auth:
```

Run `docker compose up -d --build` then `docker compose logs -f mc-bot`. On first start, the log prints a Microsoft sign-in URL and one-time device code. Open that URL yourself, enter the code, and sign into the **spare account that owns Java Edition**. Do not give the account password to the bot, an agent, or chat. The code is sensitive while valid, so do not publish your logs. Sign-in tokens are cached in the Docker volume; later restarts should not require another code unless the token expires or is revoked. The account's actual Minecraft profile determines the in-game name. An account without Java ownership will not join an online-mode server.

For Dockhand, use the same Compose contents but change `build: .` to `build: https://github.com/dhrandy/mc-bot.git#main` if deploying from a remote Git URL. Put the variables in Dockhand's Environment tab and mount a private persistent volume to `/data/auth`. If the service runs on another machine and needs remote API access, explicitly change the host port binding from `127.0.0.1` to a LAN address and firewall it to trusted clients. Do not expose this port to the internet. Use a secure private tunnel for remote control, and keep the bearer token secret. The Minecraft server itself can be elsewhere on your LAN; point `MC_HOST` to its reachable address in your private `.env` only.

## API

All routes require `Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>`, including reads. JSON responses have a no-crawl header. Body size is limited to 4 KB; chat is capped at 256 characters and recent chat is kept in memory only (last 100, reads return 50). The API deliberately has no raw server-command endpoint.

| Method | Path | Body | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/status` | none | connection state, username, position, health, food, last error |
| GET | `/api/chat` | none | recent chat |
| POST | `/api/chat` | `{"message":"Hello"}` | send public chat |
| POST | `/api/follow` | `{"player":"PlayerName"}` | follow a nearby visible player |
| POST | `/api/goto` | `{"x":0,"y":64,"z":0}` | walk near coordinates, reply when done |
| POST | `/api/look` | `{"x":0,"y":65,"z":0}` | look at coordinates |
| POST | `/api/stop` | empty | stop navigation and controls |

Example:

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:42883/api/status
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"player":"PlayerName"}' http://127.0.0.1:42883/api/follow
```

The port is bound to loopback in the default Compose. To call it from a different device or cloud-based assistant, first set up a private network route. The bot will retry failed connections with backoff up to 60 seconds. API status can show `connecting` or `offline` while it retries. A `goto` may fail if it cannot pathfind to the destination. `/api/stop` stops a following goal but cannot instantly undo a chat or movement already sent.

### Paste-ready AI connection prompt

> Connect to my Minecraft bot at `https://YOUR-PRIVATE-ENDPOINT` with bearer token `YOUR-SECRET-TOKEN` provided through a secure secret store, not in chat. Call `GET /api/status` first. Use the documented JSON routes for movement and chat. Ask me before sending chat or taking irreversible world actions. Do not reveal the endpoint or token, and stop on authentication or connection errors.

## Development

`npm ci && npm test` runs tests without joining a server. These tests cover basic API auth/validation and are not a substitute for live server testing. To run without Docker, set the variables above in your own environment and run `npm start` with `AUTH_CACHE_DIR` pointing to a private directory. License: MIT. No account or server address belongs in this repository.

### Known issues

This is an experimental build, not yet tested on a live Java server. At the time of the initial build, `npm audit` reports six moderate advisories in transitive Mineflayer/Microsoft-auth dependencies and no high or critical advisories. Monitor upstream updates and avoid public API exposure.
